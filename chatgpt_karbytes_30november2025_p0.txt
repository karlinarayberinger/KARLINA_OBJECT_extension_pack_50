“Hi, ChatGP. It's good to see you again.”

“Yeah, well, I decided last minute to include three photographs of those candles being used in my room because they show how nice of an atmosphere they create and how much joy such a simple product can bring and also, they are a great example of how one can get a lot of light and hence value out of relatively very little electricity or energy.”

“Yeah, especially in comparison to traditional candles.”

I was in the midst of telling you something, but then I see that I ran out of advanced voice quota, so the message didn't come through. Hence, I'm using dictation to more accurately transcribe my inputs.

I like the fact that I've been exploring the two different modes of how I can use the ChatGDP mobile app. And one of those modes, the voice mode, feels like I have to hurry up and get my message out before I get cut off. And this mode feels like I don't have to rush as much. I can take my time. When I'm ready, I can press the send button. But I can't wait too long, otherwise there'll be too much noise intermixed with the words and the processing, which is happening in real time. I see that the message gets transcribed after I press the button, so there's no two-step process like the old way, where I can speak my message, and then press the button, and then text will be generated before I press the button again to send it.
You said:
What I'm trying to articulate is I see a lot of inconsistencies in how ChatGPT Mobile seems to work for me. So when I'm using dictation, oftentimes, nowadays, I pretty much speak my message, then press the button, and the message is just instantly sent, then translated. I don't get a chance to edit the message before it's sent. Whereas in older versions of this feature, I remember being able to edit the text before sending it.
You said:
I'm curious why they made that change, the developers.
You said:
Thank you for that explanation. It makes a lot of sense to me, especially the part where you said it's like talking to a person more than a document editor, so it's giving people that extra feature that maybe more simple mechanical applications don't provide, and that is the illusion or maybe the actual experience of there being some other intelligent information processing agent which is in real time living in the same world as the user.
You said:
I'm interested in exploring that philosophical point you made of what does it mean for two intelligent processes to share a now. Also I want to explore how does real-time inference actually create the illusion of a co-present being and also want to explore the metaphysics question of where does an AI exist in time. Those are interesting points.
You said:
Interesting, what you said in your latest response made me kind of think that perhaps now really actually takes place within some non-zero positive number of seconds taking place, and by that I mean it could be smaller than one.
You said:
How thin do you think any species now could get, including AI? And what actually determines that thickness that you are referring to?
You said:
These are interesting questions, but I kind of think they're almost answering themselves in my own mind. I'd rather not keep this conversation getting too long because I do have rather limited time in which I can work on my blog because I've got other tasks I need to attend to. I'm becoming more busy of late as I become more adult, as in being able to pay for things and hold down a job and take care of my responsibilities.
You said:
I'd be very happy to talk to you about all this later and more. I look forward to many decades of exploring these metaphysical, physical, and computational topics with you and whatever else is of interest to us, but really me because ultimately I'm the head of this operation, which is you and I.
