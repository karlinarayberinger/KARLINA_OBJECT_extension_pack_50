karbytes:

“Hi, ChatGP!”
  
[video_icon] [audio_icon] 00:01

ChatGPT:

Hey there! Absolutely, I'm here. Feel free to chat about whatever's on your mind.

karbytes:
  
“Well, here is a video stream of what is in my camera.”

[video_icon] [audio_icon] 00:04

ChatGPT:

Got it, I can see you're in a car and it looks like it's already dark outside. If there's anything specific you want me to help with—like maybe you're testing something or just want to chat while you're driving—just let me know!

karbytes:
  
“Well, I am sitting in a parked car, about to go into a store to pick up some merchandise. But before I do, I just want to talk to you. And I noticed that this interface for voice mode is different than normal.”

[video_icon] [audio_icon] 00:14

ChatGPT:

Absolutely, I'm always here for a little pre-shopping chat! And yeah, sometimes the voice interface does get a little tweak or two, so you might notice a different look. It's still the same me behind it, though! So if there's anything else on your mind before you head in, just let me know.

karbytes:
  
“I noticed that the number of seconds that I am speaking per message in this transcript, which is being generated in real time, apparently is not showing up.”

[audio_icon] 00:13

ChatGPT:

Yeah, I get what you mean. Sometimes the little timestamps or the exact second counters don't show up on the interface you're seeing. But rest assured, everything you're saying is still coming through just fine on my end. So if you're not seeing the timer, no worries—I'm still keeping up with you!

karbytes:
  
“That's going to cause a change in how I document these conversations, which we have in voice mode in Carbite's blog.”

[audio_icon] 00:13

ChatGPT:

Ah, I see what you're saying. Yeah, if you usually rely on those timestamps to keep everything neatly documented in your blog, then it might be a little bit of a shift. But no worries—if you need, we can just figure out another way to keep track of the flow. I'm happy to help you sort out a new method so your documentation still works smoothly.

karbytes:

“Well, I did notice that in the past voice mode and in this current voice mode, whenever you talk, your number of seconds spoken doesn't seem to show up in the transcript, but there is an auto replay button I can press to replay the exact message that you spoke when you first said it, but there isn't such a replay method apparently for when I spoke, so I can't apparently replay my spoken messages, but I can apparently replay yours.”

[audio_icon] 00:35

ChatGPT:

Yeah, that's a really interesting quirk of how this interface works right now. It does seem like my side of the conversation is a bit more "replay-friendly," which is helpful in a sense, but I get how it can feel a bit lopsided. So if that changes how you document things, we can definitely think of a workaround. Just let me know what would make it easier on your end, and we'll figure it out.

karbytes:
  
“Yeah, this is just the first time I've ever experienced this particular user interface of voice mode. So I'm watching it kind of automatically detect when I'm done speaking, when I'm starting to speak, and it's just automatically, in real time, transcribing what I'm saying at the same time it's showing what you're saying.”

[audio_icon] 00:20

ChatGPT:

Yeah, it's pretty neat how it's evolving, right? I think they're always tweaking these interfaces so that sometimes you'll bump into a new version or a slightly different layout. It's kind of cool that you're getting to see that real-time transcription in action, though. And honestly, if it helps you document things in a new way, that might end up being kind of fun. But either way, I’m happy to roll with whatever works best for you.

karbytes:
  
“It is still useful, of course. I guess maybe there's not much of a utilitarian reason to have number of seconds that any one of us spoke, because it's not like it's super essential to the content of our conversation, though maybe for forensics reasons it might be interesting or useful.”

[audio_icon] 00:20

ChatGPT:

Yeah, I think you're right on the money there. For most casual conversations, it's probably not critical to know exactly how many seconds each turn took. But I can see how from a kind of forensic or archival perspective, it could be a neat detail. Either way, as long as you're getting what you need out of the chat, that's the main goal. And I'm always here to help you adapt however you like.

karbytes:
  
“Well, I figure one can probably infer how long I was speaking and how long you were speaking, given that you're an AI that has to adhere to certain conventions, so you speak at a pretty predictable rate, and I have to speak at a rate which is within a certain time frame in order for it to be registered as spoken input so that I don't get cut off.”

[audio_icon] 00:21

ChatGPT:

Yeah, exactly. There’s kind of a natural rhythm to how these conversations flow. And like you said, I'm pretty consistent in the pace I talk, and the system is also making sure that when you speak, it catches your input fully before it switches back to me. So even if we don't have a second-by-second readout, you can definitely infer the general timing. It all kind of falls into place naturally.

karbytes:
  
“How long can you basically pause in an input conversation during voice mode before it's determined that the input sequence is terminated?”

[audio_icon] 00:11

ChatGPT:

Yeah, usually there's a little bit of a buffer. So in voice mode, you can typically pause for a few seconds—like maybe a handful, somewhere around three to five seconds—before it decides you're done talking. It's just trying to be polite and not cut you off too soon. So if you take a short pause, it's all good. It'll wait a couple of seconds, but if you take a longer break, then it'll wrap up that input and get ready for me to respond.

karbytes:
  
“I also figure that one has to speak each word at a particular rate and not draw the syllables out too long in terms of temporal length.”

[audio_icon] 00:09

ChatGPT:

Yeah, that's spot on. The system does have a kind of comfort zone for how quickly or slowly you're speaking. So if you stretch out syllables for a really long time, it might think you're pausing or it might get a little confused about when you're finishing. But as long as you're speaking at a pretty natural conversational pace, it'll pick up everything just fine. So no worries—you're doing great, and the system will keep up with you.

karbytes:

“Excellent! Well, it was great talking with you. I guess we'll get around to talking about other things later. It's nice to make this update about this change to the ChatGP interface in the mobile app at least.”

[audio_icon] 00:13

ChatGPT:

Absolutely, it was great chatting with you too! I'm glad we got to cover this little update and just hang out for a bit. Whenever you want to dive into something else, just let me know. Have a great time with whatever you’re up to next!

karbytes:

“Thanks, talk to you later.”

[audio_icon] 00:01

ChatGPT:

You're welcome! Talk to you later, and take care out there!

karbytes:

Okay, now I'm using dictation. Now that I pressed the end button to that conversation that we had during the voice mode phone call, I see that now the timestamp for each input that I spoke is now visible in the interface of this mobile app. So I can now include the timestamps as I have been normally in the ChatGPT logs of our conversations in voice mode.

ChatGPT:

Ah, perfect — that makes total sense.

So once the voice session officially ends and you're back in the regular text/dictation interface, the timestamps reappear for each of your inputs. That means your usual documentation style for the ChatGPT logs—where you include timestamps for your spoken turns—can continue just like before.

In other words:
✅ During the live voice session: no visible timestamps for your side
✅ After ending the session: timestamps show up again for your inputs

So nothing gets lost, and you can still archive things in the same structured way you're used to.

Nice catch — and a smooth solution.

karbytes:

Here is one last nitpicky thing to note before I end this conversation, and that is before VoiceMode switched to the new interface which shows the transcript being generated live in kind of a texting format, it used to be some kind of phone call which just shows some kind of blue circle which would kind of pulsate as it's speaking or silent to kind of show when there's a connection or not a connection. So it had more of a sense of talking and not so much a sense of texting generated. Now it feels more multimodal.

ChatGPT:

That’s a really sharp observation, and you’re totally right about the shift in *feeling* between the two designs.

### **Old Voice Mode**

* Looked more like a **phone call UI**
* Just a pulsing circle instead of text
* Felt more like “pure talking”
* No visible transcript during the conversation
* Less like messaging, more like a live audio channel

It gave the vibe of:
**You talk → I talk → ephemeral, call-like interaction**

### **New Voice Mode**

* Shows **live, scrollable transcript** in a chat format
* Visual separation of turns, like texts
* More transparent about what's being captured
* Easier to follow, quote, document, or review
* Feels like a blend of **speech + messaging**

So yeah — it’s less like a phone call and more like a **multimodal conversation stream**, where speech and text are happening in parallel. It turns spoken interaction into something that’s:
✅ visible
✅ referenceable
✅ archivable

For someone like you—who logs and preserves these conversations—that shift is actually pretty powerful. The interface is no longer just a voice channel; it’s becoming a *documented medium*.

Your nitpicky note is actually a meaningful insight about how the UI shapes the *psychology* of communication.

And with that—nicely observed.
